## üåå Project Overview

The Universe Database is a celestial repository that encapsulates the grandeur of the cosmos. With tables dedicated to galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and even black holes, this database serves as a comprehensive archive of astronomical knowledge. Each table is a veritable treasure trove of information, meticulously designed to facilitate queries that traverse the cosmic expanse.

## üìä Database Schema

The database consists of the following illustrious tables:

- **galaxy:** A repository of galaxies, each with its own unique characteristics and attributes.
- **star:** Capturing the brilliance of stars, their ages, and their celestial homes.
- **planet:** Documenting the myriad planets that orbit these stars, revealing their potential for life.
- **moon:** A collection of moons that grace the planets, each with its own fascinating details.
- **black_hole:** A mysterious table dedicated to the enigmatic black holes that lurk in the depths of space.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Instructions

**Prerequisites:** Ensure that you have PostgreSQL installed on your machine. If not, visit the PostgreSQL official website for installation instructions.

**Clone the Repository:** Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bniladridas/universe-database.git
```

## Navigate to the Project Directory:

```
cd universe-database
```

**Create the Database:** Open your PostgreSQL command line and execute:

```
CREATE DATABASE universe;
```

**Connect to the Database:**

```
\c universe;
```

**Run the SQL Script:** Execute the provided SQL script to create the tables and insert the data:

```
\i universe.sql
```

## üå† Usage

Once the database is set up, you can start querying the cosmos! Use SQL commands to explore the vastness of the universe stored within your database. Here are a few example queries to get you started:

**Retrieve all galaxies:**

```
SELECT * FROM galaxy;
```

**Find all stars in a specific galaxy:**

```
SELECT * FROM star WHERE galaxy_id = 1;
```

**List all planets that potentially harbor life:**

```
SELECT * FROM planet WHERE has_life = TRUE;
```

## üåå Data Insertion

To add more celestial bodies to your database, simply use the INSERT INTO command with the appropriate table. For example, to add a new star:

```
INSERT INTO star (name, galaxy_id, age_in_millions_of_years, is_spherical) VALUES ('New Star', 1, 100, TRUE);
```
